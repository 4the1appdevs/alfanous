  a good-stability and a high-speed search. We want implement some 
  additional features like Highlight, Suggestions, Scoring …etc.
  by the way, a Quranic search engine is an Arabic search engine

  and eliminating of ambiguities. The API is aimed to be the base that
  the developers can use it to build different types of interfaces in 
  different systems, ex: Desktop GUI
